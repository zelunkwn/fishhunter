What is GoldDigger?
>GoldDigger is an Android Trojan with a focus on financial institutions, having been operational since at least June 2023.
>GoldDigger abuses Android's accessibility services to interact with targeted apps, extracting personal information, stealing banking credentials, logging keystrokes, capturing 2FA >codes, intercepting SMS messages, and more. The attack chain relies on fake websites that mimic Google Play Store pages and Vietnamese corporate sites, potentially distributed >through phishing tactics.

>GoldDigger employs an advanced protection mechanism, Virbox Protector, to evade detection and analysis, making it challenging to trigger malicious activity in sandboxes or emulators. GoldDigger also manipulates Accessibility Service to gain control over user actions, potentially allowing remote access to the victim's device.

>It monitors and extracts data from 51 financial apps, e-wallets, and crypto apps in Vietnam, sending it to command-and-control servers. While the full extent of its capabilities is not confirmed, it poses significant risks, including authentication bypass and remote access.[^1].

>So, is it dangerous? Yes, very dangerous
